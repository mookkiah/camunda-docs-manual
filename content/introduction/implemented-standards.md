Camunda implements three different standards in the Business Process Management scope: BPMN 2.0, CMMN 1.1 and DMN 1.1.
These three standards are defined by the [Object Management Group][OMG] with active collaboration of Camunda.

Camunda BPM provides open source implementations of execution and [modeling tools][modelers].

# BPMN

Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) is a standard for Workflow and Process Automation.
Camunda supports the 2.0 version of BPMN.

* Tool for modeling BPMN: [BPMN Modeler][modelers]
* Implementing BPMN Processes: [BPMN Implementation Reference]
* Executing BPMN: [Process Engine]

# CMMN

Case Management Model and Notation (CMMN) is a standard for Case Management.
Camunda supports the 1.1 version of CMMN.

# DMN

Decision Model and Notation (DMN) is a standard for Business Decision Management.
Camunda supports the 1.1 version of DMN.
