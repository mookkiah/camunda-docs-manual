The Camunda BPM platform provides an integration of the [Camunda DMN engine] to
evaluate Business Decisions. This section describes how to deploy Business
Decisions modeled as [DMN decision tables] together with other resources to the
repository of the Camunda BPM Platform. Deployed decisions can be evaluated
using the [Services API] or they can be referenced in BPMN processes and CMMN
cases. Evaluated decisions are saved in the [History] for auditing and reporting purposes.
